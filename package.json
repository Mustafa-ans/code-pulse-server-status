  "description": "Stay in the loop with real-time updates on your Rust code's compilation and server status directly from the VS Code status bar. We all know that compilation in Rust can take a while and if you are someone like me who does small changes to the code and compile it repeatedly, checking the terminal each time for server running status can get tiring. Enter Code Pulse, a reliable companion for efficient development, that provides a quick glance at your current status of the rust server without ever needing to open the terminal every time to do so. As of now the only language supported by this extension is Rust but later on I will be adding support for more languages in the near future. Please feel to submit pull request as I plan to keep this simple tool open source and available to expand support for as many languages as possible.",
